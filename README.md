# CS207-self-driving-raging-car

This is a repository for a Self-Driving Arduino car. 

So this vehicle uses a hypersonic sensor to look ahead and find any objects that it might hit along the way. If it finds an object directly ahead of it, it will move backwards for 1 second and then turn right.
If the vehicle collides with an object two times total, it will scream "NOO" and drive back and forth in an upset manner.
