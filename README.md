# CS207-self-driving-raging-car

This is a repository for a Self-Driving Arduino car. 

So this vehicle uses a hypersonic sensor to look ahead and find any objects that it might hit along the way. If it finds an object directly ahead of it, it will move backwards for 1 second and then turn right.
If the vehicle collides with an object two times total, it will scream "NOO" and drive back and forth in an upset manner.

Repository Contents
============

Here's a map of what I have to offer:
* **/src** - This includes my uncompiled script to get the vehicle running.
* **/hardware** - The fritzing file so you can view the circuit.
* **/img** - Where all the vehicle images and circuit images belong.
* **/LICENSE** - Runs off of the MIT license so feel free to use whatever you want.
* **/README** - This is purely for github.
